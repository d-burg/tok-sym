## 1. Transport Model

### 1.1 Energy Confinement (IPB98(y,2))

The global energy confinement time uses the ITER Physics Basis 1998 H-mode
scaling (IPB98(y,2)):

    tau_E = 0.0562 * Ip^0.93 * Bt^0.15 * ne19^0.41 * P^(-0.69)
            * R0^1.97 * eps^0.58 * kappa^0.78 * M^0.19

where Ip is in MA, Bt in T, ne19 in 10^19 m^-3, P in MW, R0 in m,
eps = a/R0, kappa is elongation, and M is the average ion mass in AMU.

### 1.2 Confinement Mode Multipliers

| Mode | H-factor | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| L-mode | 0.5 | IPB98 is calibrated to H-mode; L-mode is ~0.5x |
| H-mode | 1.0 | Standard Type I ELMy H-mode |
| NT-edge (CENTAUR) | ~0.65 | ~65% of H-mode; ELM-free, ballooning-limited edge |

### 1.3 Triangularity Correction

Higher positive triangularity (delta) stabilizes edge peeling-ballooning
modes, broadens the pressure profile, and improves energy confinement.
This effect is not captured by IPB98 (which omits delta). The correction:

    tau_E *= 1.0 + 0.20 * (delta - 0.40)    [clamped to 0.92–1.10]

At the typical H-mode reference delta=0.40, no correction is applied. At
ITER's delta=0.55, tau_E increases by ~3%. At low delta=0.20, tau_E
decreases by ~4%. This also affects Te_ped through improved pedestal
stability (see Section 9).

The correction applies in H-mode only (positive delta). Negative-delta
NT plasmas handle confinement through the h_factor multiplier instead.

### 1.4 D-T Isotope Enhancement

D-T plasmas receive a 1.10x confinement enhancement beyond the IPB98 M^0.19
scaling, representing residual isotope effects on turbulent transport beyond
what the mass scaling captures (e.g., reduced ITG growth rates). The IPB98
M^0.19 already gives ~1.19x for DT (M=2.5) vs DD (M=2.0), so the total
confinement advantage from mass alone is 1.19 × 1.10 = 1.31x on tau_E.
The dominant DT performance advantage comes from alpha self-heating, which
drives higher Te and W_th through the positive feedback loop in the power
balance.

### 1.5 Negative Triangularity Confinement

For negative-triangularity devices (CENTAUR), the confinement factor is set
to h=0.65 (between L-mode and H-mode). An additional 1.05x DT isotope boost
is applied for DT fuel. NT plasmas operate ELM-free with a small
ballooning-limited pedestal rather than the full H-mode transport barrier.

### 1.6 Device-Specific Confinement Correction

A per-device correction factor multiplies tau_E to account for effects not
captured by generic scalings (wall conditioning, NBI deposition geometry,
divertor closure, etc.):

| Device | Factor | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| DIII-D | 1.00 | IPB98 calibrated to DIII-D data directly |
| JET | 1.35 | DTE2 optimized scenarios (high shaping, ILW conditioning) |
| ITER | 1.00 | Reference machine for IPB98 extrapolation |
| CENTAUR | 1.00 | Conceptual design, no empirical correction |

### 1.7 Intrinsic Radiation

Intrinsic impurity radiation from wall materials (carbon, tungsten,
beryllium) is modeled as a fraction of external heating power:

    P_intrinsic = (0.10 * max(Z_eff - 1, 0.2) + 0.05) * P_external

This produces ~10-15% radiative fraction for typical H-mode parameters,
consistent with experimental observations in well-conditioned machines.
The scaling with P_external (rather than ne^2 * V) avoids unphysical
machine-size dependence and ensures the intrinsic radiation doesn't
suppress the alpha self-heating loop in burning plasmas.

---

## 2. Fusion Power

### 2.1 Reactivity

The D-T and D-D fusion reactivities use the Bosch-Hale parameterization,
which is accurate to within 1% over the range 0.2-100 keV.

**D-T reaction:** D + T -> He-4 (3.52 MeV) + n (14.07 MeV)
**D-D reactions:** Two branches with roughly equal probability, producing
~3.65 MeV per reaction on average.

The effective ion temperature for the volume-averaged reactivity is estimated
as Ti_eff = 0.70 * Te0, accounting for profile peaking and the Ti/Te ratio.

**References:**
- Bosch and Hale, Nucl. Fusion 32 (1992) 611

### 2.2 Profile Correction Factor

The 0D alpha heating uses a profile peaking correction f_profile = 0.48,
representing the ratio of the volume-averaged <n^2 * sigma_v(T)> to the
product of volume-averaged quantities n_bar^2 * sigma_v(T_bar). This factor
accounts for the fact that both density and temperature peak on axis.
(Calibrated against full profile integration using Bosch-Hale over the
51-point Te/ne profiles.)

The displayed P_fus in the status panel and trace uses the full 51-point
profile integration via `computeFusion()`, which integrates ne^2 * sigma_v(Te)
over the tanh-pedestal profiles. The 0D f_profile estimate is used only for
the alpha self-heating feedback in the transport power balance.

### 2.3 Q_plasma

    Q_plasma = P_fusion / P_external

where P_external = P_input - P_alpha (i.e., the externally supplied heating
power excluding self-heating from alpha particles).

## 3. ELM Model

### 3.1 ELM Types

| Type | Frequency | Energy Loss | Character |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Type I | 5-25 Hz (DIII-D scale) | 5-13% W_th | Large, distinct crashes |
| Type II | 80-200 Hz (DIII-D scale) | 0.5-1.5% W_th | Small "grassy" ELMs |
| Suppressed (QCE) | N/A | Continuous small losses | No discrete ELMs |

ELM frequency scales inversely with energy confinement time (tau_E) to
account for machine size: larger machines with longer tau_E have lower ELM
frequency because the pedestal pressure gradient rebuilds more slowly.

### 3.2 Pedestal Crash

Each ELM applies an amplified fractional crash to the pedestal Te and ne:

    Te_ped *= (1 - elm_fraction * 1.5)    [Type I]
    Te_ped *= (1 - elm_fraction * 1.2)    [Type II]
    ne_ped *= (1 - elm_fraction * 0.8 * amplification)

The pedestal recovery time is 100ms (tau_ped), representing the inter-ELM
pedestal pressure gradient rebuild.

### 3.3 ELM Heat Flux to Divertor

The ELM energy to the divertor is calculated from the Loarte scaling:

    Delta_W_ELM = elm_fraction * W_th  (5-13% for Type I)

The resulting transient heat flux spike is:

    q_ELM = Delta_W_ELM / (A_wet * tau_ELM)

where tau_ELM ~ 0.5-1.0 ms is the ELM crash duration and A_wet is the
divertor wetted area (including flux expansion).

## 4. Divertor Heat Flux

### 4.1 Scrape-Off Layer Width (Eich Scaling)

The SOL power decay length uses the Eich multi-machine scaling:

    lambda_q = 1.35 / B_pol^0.9  (mm)

with a minimum of 0.5 mm. For negative-triangularity configurations, lambda_q
is broadened by a factor of 1.0-2.0 depending on the triangularity magnitude.

- Eich et al., Nucl. Fusion 53 (2013) 093031

### 4.2 Detachment Model

A simplified sigmoid model for divertor detachment:

    f_detach = min(1 - 1/(1 + (f_GW/0.7)^6), 0.97)

Higher Greenwald fraction drives stronger divertor radiation and detachment,
reducing the target heat flux. Maximum detachment reduces heat flux by 97%.

---

## 5. Divertor Thermal Model

### 5.1 Approach

The divertor surface temperature is computed using a **0D lumped thermal
capacitance model**:

    C_th * dT/dt = q_total - h_cool * (T - T_coolant)

where:
- C_th = rho * cp * L is the thermal capacitance per unit area (J/m^2/K)
- q_total is the total heat flux including inter-ELM and ELM contributions
- h_cool is the effective heat transfer coefficient to the coolant
- T_coolant is the coolant temperature

### 5.2 Device-Specific Parameters

| Parameter | DIII-D | JET | ITER | CENTAUR |
|-----------|--------|-----|------|---------|
| Wall material | Carbon (C) | Tungsten (W) | Tungsten (W) | Tungsten (W) |
| Armor thickness (mm) | 25 | 22 | 6 | 6 |
| Density (kg/m^3) | 1800 | 19350 | 19350 | 19350 |
| Specific heat (J/kg/K) | 1200 | 150 | 150 | 150 |
| T_coolant (C) | 25 | 200 | 100 | 80 |
| h_cool (W/m^2/K) | 0 | 0 | 8500 | 15000 |
| Cooling type | Inertial | Inertial | Active water | Active water |

### 5.3 Target Steady-State Temperatures

| Device | Condition | Model Prediction | Published/Expected Range |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| DIII-D | 5 MW/m^2, 3 s pulse | ~300 C | 200-600 C |
| JET | 7 MW/m^2, 8 s pulse | ~1000 C | 600-1200 C (JOI limit) |
| ITER | 10 MW/m^2, steady-state | ~1300 C | 1200-1500 C (design basis) |

### 5.4 Known Limitations

**Single-layer approximation:** The model treats the divertor armor as a
single thermal lump with uniform temperature. In reality, ELM energy deposits
in a very thin surface skin (~0.1 mm thermal diffusion depth at tau_ELM ~ 1 ms).
This means:

- **ELM temperature spikes are underestimated**: The real surface temperature
  during an unmitigated Type I ELM on ITER can transiently exceed tungsten's
  melting point (3422 C), but our model spreads the energy across the full
  6 mm armor thickness, producing a modest ~100-200 C rise.

- **ELM temperature recovery is too slow**: The real surface cools back to
  near-steady-state within ~10-100 ms as heat diffuses into the cooler bulk.
  Our lumped model shows recovery over seconds because the full thermal mass
  must equilibrate.

- **Qualitative behavior is correct**: The model correctly shows that (1) ITER
  DT H-mode with unmitigated Type I ELMs produces dangerously high divertor
  temperatures, (2) actively cooled devices equilibrate while inertially cooled
  devices heat monotonically, and (3) the inter-ELM steady-state temperatures
  match published design values.

A two-layer model (thin surface skin + bulk substrate) would capture the
fast transient dynamics more accurately but is not currently implemented.

## 6. Equilibrium and MHD

### 6.1 Flux Surface Geometry

The equilibrium flux surfaces are computed from a parameterized
Grad-Shafranov-like model using the Miller parameterization (R, Z, kappa,
delta_upper, delta_lower). The poloidal flux function psi is constructed
analytically with Shafranov shift and shaping corrections.

### 6.2 Safety Factor

    q95 = 5 * a^2 * Bt * f_shape / (R0 * Ip)

where the shape factor includes elongation and triangularity:

    f_shape = (1 + kappa^2 * (1 + 2*delta^2 - 1.2*delta^3)) / 2

### 6.3 Normalized Beta

    beta_N = beta_t * a * Bt / Ip  (in percent-meters-Tesla/MA)

The Troyon stability limit is approximately beta_N ~ 2.8 for standard
H-mode and up to ~3.5 for advanced scenarios.

### 6.4 Internal Inductance

    li = <B_pol^2> / B_pol(a)^2

Evolves based on current profile shape, with the L-H transition causing
a characteristic broadening of the current profile (decreasing li).

---

## 7. Disruption Model

Disruptions are triggered when operational limits are violated:

- **Density limit (Greenwald):** f_GW > 1.0
- **Beta limit (Troyon):** beta_N > beta_N_max
- **Safety factor limit:** q95 < 2.0
- **Locked modes:** Large locked mode amplitude

The disruption probability increases as multiple limits are approached
simultaneously. A thermal quench (rapid loss of stored energy) is followed
by a current quench (rapid loss of plasma current).

---

## 8. Diagnostic Noise Model

All simulated diagnostic signals include realistic measurement noise:

| Signal | Noise Level | Basis |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Ip | 0.2% | Rogowski coil precision |
| ne_bar | 1% | Interferometer noise |
| Te0 | 2% | ECE radiometer |
| W_th | 0.5% | Diamagnetic loop |
| P_rad | 5% | Bolometer uncertainties |

D-alpha signals include ELM spikes (8x baseline for Type I, 2.5x for Type II)
with appropriate noise to reproduce the irregular appearance of real signals.

---

## 9. Radial Profiles and 0D Coupling

### 9.1 Profile Parameterization

H-mode profiles use the OMFIT tanh-pedestal parameterization with independently
shaped core and pedestal regions. L-mode uses a simple parabolic model.

### 9.2 0D → Profile Coupling

The 0D transport model determines W_th from power balance and derives:

    Te_avg = W_th / (3 * ne_vol * V * 1.602e-2)
    Te0 = Te_avg * 2.5    (peaking factor)
    ne0 = ne_bar * 1.3    (density peaking)

The profile module then sets:

    Te_core = Te0 (smoothed with 150ms tau)
    Te_ped = ped_ratio * Te0, where ped_ratio = 0.30 + 0.20 * delta
             (clamped to 0.25-0.50; positive delta only)
    ne_core = ne0
    ne_ped = 0.55 * ne0

The pedestal height depends on triangularity: higher delta stabilizes
peeling-ballooning modes, allowing higher pedestal pressure.

For negative-triangularity (NT-edge) plasmas, a small ballooning-limited
pedestal is maintained: Te_ped ≈ 0.12 * Te0, ne_ped ≈ 0.40 * ne0.

### 9.3 Profile Energy Normalization

After the profile parameters are set, the Te core value is rescaled so
that the profile-integrated stored energy matches the 0D W_th:

    W_profiles = integral(3 * ne(rho) * Te(rho) * dV) * 1.602e-2

If W_profiles differs from W_th, Te_core is scaled by W_th/W_profiles
(clamped to 0.6-1.8x). Only the core is adjusted — the pedestal height
is preserved since it is set by MHD stability, not global energy content.

The W_th input to normalization is smoothed with a time constant equal
to tau_E (minimum 50ms), preventing ELM crashes from instantly
propagating to the core profile. This reflects the physical reality
that fusion reactions are concentrated in the hot core, which acts as
a thermal low-pass filter — edge perturbations propagate inward on the
energy confinement timescale, not the ELM crash timescale.

### 9.4 Tuning Coefficients

| Parameter | Value | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Te0 peaking factor | 2.5 | Te0 = Te_avg * 2.5 |
| ne0 peaking factor | 1.3 | ne0 = ne_bar * 1.3 |
| ne_vol / ne_bar | 0.85 | Volume-average density |
| Ped_ratio base | 0.30 | Te_ped / Te0 at delta=0 |
| Ped_ratio delta coeff | 0.20 | Additional Te_ped per unit delta |
| ne_ped / ne0 | 0.55 | ~0.72 * ne_bar in H-mode |
| NT Te_ped / Te0 | 0.12 | Small ballooning-limited pedestal |
| Pedestal tau | 100 ms | Pedestal recovery timescale |
| Core smoothing tau | 150 ms | Core ELM resilience |
